# DIKSHA AI LABS Website Walkthrough

I have created a premium, modern, and futuristic website for DIKSHA AI LABS.

## Features
- **Luxury Tech Aesthetic**: Deep dark background with neon cyan and purple accents.
- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects on cards and navigation for a high-end feel.
- **Interactive Background**: A custom particle system built with HTML5 Canvas that responds to mouse movement (simulated via code, but visual).
- **Smooth Animations**: Elements fade in and slide up as you scroll.
- **3D Elements**: A CSS-only floating 3D orb in the hero section.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.

## Files
- **[index.html](file:///c:/Users/hubai/Documents/dikshiAi/index.html)**: The main structure.
- **[styles.css](file:///c:/Users/hubai/Documents/dikshiAi/styles.css)**: All styling, animations, and responsive rules.
- **[script.js](file:///c:/Users/hubai/Documents/dikshiAi/script.js)**: Particle background logic and scroll animations.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No build process is required as it uses Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Verification
- **Hero Section**: Check for the floating orb and particle background.
- **Services**: Verify all 7 services are listed with glass cards.
- **Mobile**: Resize the browser to check the mobile menu and layout adjustments.
